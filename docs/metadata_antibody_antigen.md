# Metadata for Antibody-Antigen pairs used to create figure 5a

Figure 5a in the AlphaFold 3 paper was created using 71 antibody–antigen
complexes, containing 166 antibody–antigen interfaces spanning 65 interface
clusters. Scores were averaged within each interface cluster then across
clusters. Note that the first bioassembly is used in all cases.

We provide metadata for these complexes and the associated clusters in this CSV
file:
